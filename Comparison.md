# CircleCI vs TravisCI vs CodeShip vs Jenkins

## Abstract
The idea for this document is to help you decide which of these four Continuous Integration systems to use depending on your priorities, using an scaffold application created with [a generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack). The application uses `nodejs 4.4.6`, `npm`, `gulp` and connects to `mongod`. This document does not cover the delivery process.
